# AI for Medicine — Medical Diagnosis using-Deep-Learning

This notebook is part of my learning work from the **AI for Medicine specialization on Coursera**. It focuses on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to medical diagnosis tasks, including disease detection from medical data and evaluation strategies suited for healthcare environments.

## Objectives

- Build and evaluate AI models for medical diagnosis  
- Understand challenges in healthcare datasets  
- Apply appropriate evaluation metrics  
- Practice real-world ML workflows  

## Learning Context

Medical AI introduces unique modeling challenges such as class imbalance, missing data, and domain-sensitive evaluation. This notebook demonstrates how to approach these challenges using practical machine learning techniques.
